What did you learn during this project?
In this project, our group was relatively new to React.js and Javascript as a whole. We learned how to use different node modules and react libraries to render cool visuals and create components to design different panels in a react application. Furthermore, we also learned how to collaborate with each other and designate tasks for everyone.
What did you enjoy during this project?
The most enjoyable thing during this project was being able to connect the algorithms like recursive backtracking that we discussed in class with front end and web design. We enjoyed working with industry frameworks like React.js and this was a great introduction on how to use these frameworks in a performant way. We learnt about several new libraries like React Flow and using the google maps javascript API with react.
What did you find challenging or frustrating during this project?
The most challenging portion of this project was connecting all the different components of our user interface together. It took a great deal of debugging and troubleshooting to ensure that the output generated from one class can be used to perform a function or generate a visual in another class. We also found that with three people working on the same project it was difficult to combine and debug our work. 
What did you find particularly helpful for your learning during this project?
In finding solutions to problems we ran into along the way, we found it helpful to learn from others who had tackled a similar problem in the past. Since our project is very similar to that of a travelling salesman problem, youtube videos that gave a step-by-step breakdown of the problem proved to be helpful. Also, the help we received from the TA in our check-in meeting gave us insight on how to bring this project to life from a client perspective.
