## Navigate to the folder

Open command prompt or terminal (depending on the os). Navigate to the “StadiumHopping” directory using `cd` commands.

Under the “StadiumHopping” directory, type `npm install --save` then enter to install all the necessary modules for the project to successfully run.

## Start the webapp on the localhost server

Then under the same “StadiumHopping” directory path type `npm start` to run the project. Make sure you have a strong internet connection. After less than 15 seconds a chrome tab should appear with the Stadium Hopping User Interface.

## Setup the data

Choose a sports dataset (NFL/NBA) using the dropdown on the left and use the refresh button to randomize the teams until a desired grouping is reached. Adjust the time delay using the slider on the right based on how quickly you wish to see the algorithm run.

## Run the algorithm

Click “Start” to begin the algorithm. The Graph Visualizer on the right should update according to the paths being visited and the Map on the left should update at the very end when an optimal path is reached.
